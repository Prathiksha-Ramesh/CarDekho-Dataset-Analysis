# CarDekho Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and imputation of missing data in the **CarDekho** dataset. The project covers the entire process from data preprocessing and imputation to model evaluation and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
- **Model Implementation**: Application of machine learning techniques for classification and regression tasks.
- **Visualization**: Data visualization using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluation of model performance using various metrics and visual plots.
- **Deployment**: Ready to be deployed as a Jupyter notebook for demonstration or further development.

## File Structure

- `notebook.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the project.
- `.gitignore`: Files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `cardekho_imputated.csv`: The dataset used for the project, which has been processed to handle missing values.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd yourrepository
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
    ```

2. **Follow the instructions in the notebook** to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
